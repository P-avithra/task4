            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It structures content using elements and tags, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML is essential for web development, providing the foundation for web page content and layout, and is enhanced by CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles HTML content, defining the look and layout of web pages. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS enables responsive design, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes. It's essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p>

            <h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web content. It allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, validate forms, and create animations. JavaScript is essential for modern web development, enhancing user experience and enabling complex web applications.</p>

            <h2>SASS</h2>
            <p>Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins. It makes writing and managing CSS easier and more efficient, allowing for cleaner, more organized stylesheets. Sass compiles into standard CSS for browser compatibility.</p>

            <h2>REACT</h2>
            <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. Developed by Facebook, it uses a component-based architecture to create reusable UI components and manage state efficiently. React's virtual DOM optimizes rendering, making it faster and more responsive for complex web applications.</p>
